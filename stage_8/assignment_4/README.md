# Stage 8 - Assignment 4: Conflict Resolution During Merge

## Objectives

- Resolve merge conflicts between master and a feature branch
- Use Git tools and manual editing to resolve conflicts
- Update `.gitignore` to exclude backup files

## Steps Performed

1. Created `GitWork` branch and added `hello.xml`
2. Modified `hello.xml` in both master and branch to create conflict
3. Merged `GitWork` into master and resolved conflict manually
4. Used `git log`, `git diff`, and optionally `P4Merge` for visualization
5. Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.orig` files

## Outcome

Conflict resolved successfully and changes committed to master.
